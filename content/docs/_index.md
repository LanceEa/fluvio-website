title: Fluvio Data Streaming Platform
---

Fluvio is an open source, **cloud native** platform designed to work with <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a>. The platform has two core Microservices, SC and SPU that can be containerized, independently provisioned, and dynamically orchestrated. The platform was designed for **horizontal scale** where new components are seamlessly absorbed without disruption to the overall health of the system.

Fluvio can be deployed in any **public cloud** and **private data centers** where Kubernetes is available. 

## ...

We believe __data streaming__ is a fundamental building block to deliver real-time stateful App. 

Why would I be interested as a developer? Why should I use this rather than other technologies ?

* composable
* functional
* reactive
* async
* eventual consistency


What can I do with it? Use Cases & Benefits

* build real-time apps
* connect distributed services with low latency
* traffic routing (many to many)
* easy to distribute apps

### Existing Solutions

Problem ... with the ecosystem
* Existing platform are heavy weight, narrow focused, not universal.

### A Better Way
* Build a low footprint, universal, accessible in any language, easy to integrate, expanding natively to low footprint environment. 
* Designed for distributed cloud-native environment.
* Suitable for edge.

### What is Fluvio?

Fluvio is a real-time __data streaming platform__ ...

* Open Source
* You can deploy your in cloud or on premise.
* Designed to work natively in Kubernetes or bare metal platforms.
* Powerful CLI
* Control/Data Plane
* Native Node API (other language bindings upcoming)
