**Distributed Data Infrastructure (DDI)** is a **standards-based**, **language agnostic** software that glues services to distributed data. It allows services to share data without coding the data layer itself.

The benefits are shorter time to market, better code quality, and the ability to add out of band data management features such as role based access, auditing, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

The **Distribute Data Infrastructure** is:

* **Language agnostic** - use your favorite language, Java, C++, TypeScript, Go, Scala, Ruby, etc.
* **Versatile** - covers many distributed data data use cases from CQRS to Saga out of the box.
* **Painless** - you don't have to be a distributed data wizard to operate it.
* **Expressive** - just define the workflow, the chain of services and the data they exchange, no coding required.
* **Traceable** - track, debug, and monitor any data as it traverses services.
* **Secure** - apply corporate data policy without rebuilding or deploying application code.
* **Compliant** - perform data audits without impacting the application.

The DDI **democratizes** the use of data across the organization.
