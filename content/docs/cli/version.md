As Fluvio evolves, the Command Line Interface (CLI) will also change to support additional features. We intend to keep Fluvio backward compatible with previous versions.

The Fluvio Command Line and Fluvio services should run the same version. We recommend to update the CLI each time a new version of the system becomes available.

## Check Version

For example, use version flag to check Fluvio CLI __version__ number:

{{< cli yaml >}}
$ fluvio --version
fluvio 0.1.0-alpha.1
{{< /cli >}}
