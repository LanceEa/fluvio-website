Welcome! Thanks for your interest in Fluvio, the high-performance, low-latency
streaming platform for real-time applications. In this guide, we're going to
walk through the setup process for getting started with Fluvio. There are two
main steps:

- Installing the Fluvio CLI tool
- Getting access to a Fluvio cluster

There are two main ways to get access to a Fluvio cluster. The quickest way is
by creating a [free Fluvio Cloud account], but we'll also cover how to install
your own Fluvio cluster locally if you prefer that type of setup.

## Getting access to a Fluvio cluster

The easiest way to get started with a Fluvio cluster is by creating a
[free Fluvio Cloud account] since we take care of setting up all the moving parts.
If you go the Fluvio Cloud route, you can skip the rest of this page and continue on
to the [Hello Fluvio] example.
