The quickest way to get started is with [Fluvio Cloud]({{< relref "../fluvio-cloud/cloud-platform" >}}). The cloud platform runs **[Fluvio Open Source]({{< relref "../fluvio-oss/oss-platform/" >}}) as a Service**, where the storage and runtime environment are handled by the platform. Every account gets a dedicated environment provisioned with 1 x [Streaming Controller]({{< relref "../architecture/sc/" >}}) (SC) and 3 x [Streaming Processing Units]({{< relref "../architecture/spu/" >}}) (SPU).
