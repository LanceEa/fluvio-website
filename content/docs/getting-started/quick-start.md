The quickest path to data streaming is with [Fluvio Cloud]({{< relref "../fluvio-cloud/cloud-platform" >}}). Every account gets a dedicated **[Fluvio Open Source]({{< relref "../fluvio-oss/oss-platform/" >}})** installation in the cloud, provisioned with 1 x [Streaming Controller]({{< relref "../architecture/sc/" >}}) (SC) and 3 x [Streaming Processing Units]({{< relref "../architecture/spu/" >}}) (SPU).
