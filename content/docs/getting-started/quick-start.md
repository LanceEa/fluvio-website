The quickest way to data streaming is with [Fluvio Cloud]({{< relref "../fluvio-cloud/cloud-platform" >}}). The cloud platform runs **[Fluvio Open Source]({{< relref "../fluvio-oss/oss-platform/" >}}) as a Service**, where  installation, storage, and the runtime environment are handled by the platform. When you sign up, we provision a dedicated environment with 1 x [Streaming Controller]({{< relref "../architecture/sc/" >}}) (SC) and 3 x [Streaming Processing Units]({{< relref "../architecture/spu/" >}}) (SPU) and assign it to your account.


Let's get started:

* [Create a Fluvio Cloud account]({{< ref "#create-fluvio-account" >}})
* [Download and configure Command Line Interface]({{< ref "#download-and-configure-cli" >}})
* [Create topic and stream "Hello World"]({{< ref "#create-topic-and-stream-hello-world">}})
* [Create Node app and stream "Hello from Node"]({{< ref "#create-node-app-and-stream-hello-from-node">}})
