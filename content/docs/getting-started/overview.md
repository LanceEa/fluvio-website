Fluvio platform is cloud-native by design and it requires access to a Kubernetes cluster.  
The fastest way to get up an running on your local MAC or a Linux installation is by using [Minikube]({{< relref "minikube" >}}).

Alternatively, fluvio can be installed on an existing Kubernetes cluster.  
We currently supports:  

* [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
