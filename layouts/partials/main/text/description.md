================


Next generation collaboration tools, distributed Apps, data pipelines, ML streams, IOT aggregators need a powerful infrastructure to process **data in real-time**.

Fluvio is an **open source** data streaming platform **built for developers**.  Whether you're looking to add data streaming capabilities to your application, need to aggregate logs for your infrastructure, or are seeking a Change Data Capture (CDC) solution, Fluvio is the data streaming platform for you.

<ins>Alpha-1</ins> focuses on **core data streaming** use cases such as _Log aggregation_, _Db capture (CDC)_, and simple _Collaboration Apps_. 

=================

Expectations for Apps that deliver **data in real-time** is at an all-time high.

The need for data driven collaborative tools - with emphasis on real-time decision making - is at an all-time high.


Everything is going digital, off touch, automated, highly 
customizable, self healing, and ML driven.

collaboration based on data pipelines is critical.   data stream based infrastructure is key to unlock that productivity...

The need for data driven collaborative tools - with emphasis on real-time decision making - is at an all-time high.


=======================

without data driven infrastructure   and capability,  your businesses are dead in post covid world.   everything is going digital,  off touch, automated, highly customizable, massive sensor integration and ML driven algorithm.

=======================

Expectations for application with real-time data analysis and decision making capabilities is at an all-time high. 

With Fluvio **real-time streaming platform** developers can give their application a highly resilient data layer optimized for speed, scale, security and resiliency. 

=======================

Build powerful distributed apps on Fluvio **real-time streaming** platform. Cloud native backend and small footprint client, makes it ideal for any environment, _data center_, _cloud_ , or _IOT_

No infrastructure to manage, just create an account on [Fluvio Cloud](docs/getting-started/quick-start/) and start streaming. Checkout our blog [From zero to streaming in 5 minutes](/docs/getting-started/overview/)
